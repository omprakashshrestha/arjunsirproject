        <h4>Web Development</h4>
        <p>Web development is the work involved in
          developing a website for the Internet
          (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private
          network).[1] Web development can range from
          developing a simple single static page of
          plain text to complex web-based internet
          applications (web apps), electronic businesses,
          and social network services. A more
          comprehensive list of tasks to which web
          development commonly refers, may include web
          engineering, web design, web content development,
          client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting,
          web server and network security configuration,
          and e-commerce development.

          Among web professionals, "web development"
          usually refers to the main non-design aspects
          of building websites: writing markup and coding.
          [2] Web development may use content management
          systems (CMS) to make content changes easier
          and available with basic technical skills.

      <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight,

        as the scripting language for Web pages,
        many non-browser environments also use it,
        such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.
